# 6.3 Polarisation
2022-10-03 | [[PAGS]]

## Polarisation Filters
- We set up the equipment so that a ray box was connected to a power supply at 12V
- We then slid polarising filters at different angles into the ray box
	- When `filter 1` #TODO

## Polarisation of Microwaves
- We set up the equipment so that a microwave transmitter was around 30cm away from a microwave receiver
- We then rotated the microwave reciever to $90 \degree$
	- As we did this slowly, the noise created by the receiver decreased until there was a very small amount of noise at $90 \degree$
- We then rotated the microwave receiver to $180 \degree$
	- As we did this slowly, the noise created by the receiver increased until the noise was back to normal like at $0 \degree$, which means that it was back at $180 \degree$
- We then placed a pane of vertical bars between the transmitter and receiver and no change in noise was noted
- We then placed a pane of horizontal bars between the transmitter and receiver and the noise created by the receiver became extremely quiet
- This must mean that the microwaves from the transmitter are vertically polarised as it was blocked by horizontal bars and let through by vertical ones
