# 5.3 Oscilloscopes
2022-09-03 | [[PAGs]]

## Method
- We setup the equipment so that a signal generator on a multiplier of 10 kHz was connected coaxially to an oscilloscope
- We adjusted the settings of the oscilloscope such that it displayed a singular sine wave from the signal generator and the time base $10 \micro s$ and the y position of the wave to be in the centre of the oscilloscope's display 
	- We then adjusted the frequency of the signal generator in adjustments of 1, therefore making the frequency 10kHz, 20kHz, etc.
- We then measured the amount of divisions from one peak to the next adjacent peak, then multiplied that by the time base to get the time period
- We then took the reciprocal of the time period to give us the frequency (as $f = \frac{1}{T}$)

## Results
| Period (T) | Frequency (f, kHz) | Expected Frequency (f, kHz) |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 4.8        | 21                 | 30                          |
| 3.5        | 29                 | 40                          |
| 3.2        | 31                 | 50                          |
| 2.6        | 38                 | 60                          |
| 2.1        | 48                 | 70                          |
| 1.9        | 53                 | 80                          |
| 1.7        | 59                 | 90                          |
| 1.5        | 67                 | 100                         |
| 1.4        | 71                 | 110                         |
|            |                    |                             |
## Conclusion
- As we increased the frequency on the signal generator, the frequency we calculated on the oscilloscope got further and further away from the expected value set on the signal generator, therefore we believe that the signal generator was inaccurate
