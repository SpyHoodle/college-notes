# 6.1 Determining the Planck constant
2022-11-07 | [[PAGs]]

## Aim
The aim of this experiment was to determine the value of the Planck constant using LEDs, multi-meters and the equation $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$.

## Equipment
- Two multi-meters
- Power supply
- Box of LEDs
- Cables

## Method
We used a box that contained a series of LEDs that emitted different wavelengths of light (and therefore different colours.) We connected this box to two multi-meters via standard cables, with one being used as a voltmeter and one being used as an ammeter. We connected the box of LEDs to a power supply.

We then used a black tube to look down the first LED, which reduced the excess light and made it easier to see when the LED showed some light. We adjusted the voltage until the very faintest light showed through the LED and then wrote down the voltage showing on the voltmeter. We repeated this for the rest of the LEDs.

However the last two LEDs didn't emit any visible light as the wavelength was too high and therefore emitted infrared. Therefore for the last two we adjusted the voltage until a very tiny amount of amps showed on the ammeter ($0.02 \text{ A}$ for each.)

- Using excel, we were able to calculate...
	-  $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ (reciprocal of wavelength in metres) using the formula `=1/($AX*(1E-9)`
	- $E$ (energy in joules) using the formula `=$BX*(1.6E-19)`
	- Where `A` is the first column and `B` is the second

From these points we drew a graph on Excel as seen in Figure 1. We then calculated the equation of the of the trend line to be $y = (1.2*10^{-25})x - (3.7*10^{-20})$. The y intercept should be zero, and the value we got for the y intercept is not far from the expected value. The gradient is $hc$, therefore diving the gradient by $c$, the speed of light, gives us our $h$, planks constant.

## Conclusion
Our value for $h$ was worked out to be $4.02*10^{-34}$, which is not far off the real value of $6.02*10-34$. This means that the value given from our experiment was $39\%$ absolutely out from the actual value.
