# Stationary Waves in Air Columns
2022-10-13 | [[12 Waves 2]]

## Air Columns
- Anti-node at the open end, node at the closed end of the column
- Anti-nodes and nodes have to alternate
- Anti-nodes always are on the sides of the column, and nodes are always in the middle

## Open-End Columns
- **First harmonic** $f_0$ in an open-end column
