# Interference
2022-10-06 | [[12 Waves 2]]

- **Interference** -> Superposition of two progressive waves from coherent sources to produce a resultant wave with displacement equal to the sum of the individual displacements from the two waves
- **Coherence** -> Two wave sources, or waves, that have a constant phase difference
- **Path Difference** -> The difference in the distance travelled by two waves from the source to a specific point
	- If the path difference is an integer number of wavelengths then it will form a maxima
	- $\text{Constructive Interference} = n \lambda$
		- Where n is 0, 1, 2, 3...
	- If the path difference is out by half a wavelength it will form a minima
	- $\text{Destructive Interference} = (n + \frac{1}{2}) \lambda$
	- Measured in $\lambda$ or standard distance (e.g. cm, mm, m)

### Phase Difference
- If phase difference is an even number of $\pi$ radians then it will form a maxima, vice versa for an odd number of $\pi$ radians
