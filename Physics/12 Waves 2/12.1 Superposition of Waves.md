# Superposition of Waves
2022-10-05 | [[12 Waves 2]]

- **Principal of Superposition of Waves** -> When two waves of the same type meet at the same point where the resultant displacement at that point is equal to the sum of the displacements of the individual waves
- **Coherent Waves** -> Constant resultant phase

## Superposition to interference
- **Constructive Interference** -> Peaks and troughs always align (maxima)
	- Superposition of two waves in phase so that the resultant wave has a greater amplitude than the original wave
- **Destructive Interference** -> Peaks align with troughs and vice-versa (minima)
	- Superposition of two waves in anti-phase so that the waves cancel each other out and the resultant wave has a smaller amplitude than the original waves
- Amplitude of combined wave = sum of amplitude of separate waves
