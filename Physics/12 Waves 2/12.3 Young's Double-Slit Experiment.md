# Young's Double-Slit Experiment
2022-10-10 | [[12 Waves 2]]

- **Fringes** -> When light from a laser is directed through a double-slit a series of equally spaced dots of lights are seen on the screen
	- This is because as we move along the screen path the difference between waves from the slits changes, when the path difference is $n \lambda$ there is constructive interference and there is a maxima (forming a bright fringe), when the path difference is $(n+\frac{1}{2} \lambda$) there is destructive interference and a minima
- Bright fringes are due to constructive interference
- $\lambda = \frac{ax}{D}$
- $a$ = Separation of double slits (m)
- $x$ = Separation of two adjacent bright or dark fringes (m)
- $D$ = Distance of double slits to screen (m)
