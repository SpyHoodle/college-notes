# 12.4 Stationary Waves
2022-10-12 | [[12 Waves 2]]

## Properties of a Stationary Wave
- **Stationary Wave** -> Incident wave that reflects and interferes with the next incident wave forming nodes and antinodes
	- **Node** -> Point which does not move (no displacement)
	- **Anti-node** -> Point which vibrates with a maximum displacement
	- The particles in one loop of stationary waves are out of phase by $180 \degree$ or $\pi$ radians
	- 1 wavelength $\lambda$ is two loops of a stationary wave
	- Stationary wave of a fixed string always has nodes at each end
	- Energy is therefore trapped in the system and not transferred
	- Parts of the wave between adjacent nodes are in phase, either side of a node are in anti-phase

## Formation of a Stationary Wave
- The incident waves travel down the medium (pipes, strings, etc.) and reflects
- The reflected wave and the incident wave interfere
- Constructive interference forms anti-nodes
- Destructive interference forms nodes
