# Young Double-Slit Experiment
2022-10-10 | [[12 Waves 2]]

- When light from a laser is directed through a double-slit a series of equally spaced dots of lights are seen on the screen
- Bright fringes are due to constructive interference
- $\lambda = \frac{ax}{D}$
- $a$ = Separation of double slits (m)
- $x$ = Separation of two adjecent bright or dark fringes (m)
- $D$ = Distance of double slits to screen (m)
