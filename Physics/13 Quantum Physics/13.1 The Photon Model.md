# The Photon Model
2022-11-07 | [[13 Quantum Physics]]

## Energy of a photon
- $E = hf$
	- The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency
	- $h = 6.63 \cdot 10^{-34}$
	- $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$

## Electron Volt
- Joule isn't good for very small or large quantities -> photon energy is very small
- For very large quantities we use $\text{kWh}$
- For very small quantities we use $\text{eV}$
	- $W = QV = eV$
	- $1eV = 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} \text{J}$
- $eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
