# The Photoelectric Effect & Einstein's Photoelectric Equation
2022-11-10 | [[13 Quantum Physics]]

## The Photoelectric Effect
- The emissions of photoelectrons from a metal surface when light above a certain frequency is incident on the metal
- This is because $E = hf$,as $f$ increases $E$ increases

### Experiment
- Mount a clean zinc plate (rubbed with emory paper to make it pure zinc) on the cap of a gold leaf electroscope
- The plate is charged negatively - which makes the gold leaf move away from the stem
- A good ultraviolet lamp is shone on the plate
- The gold leaf collapses back towards the stem as the charge leaks away from the plate when the UV light is incident on the plate
- The experiment shows that the photons of UV light are causing the emission of negative charge / electrons

### Threshold Frequency
- **Threshold frequency** $f_0$ (Hz) -> To get photoelectrons emitted, the incident radiation's frequency has to be above a certain value, no matter what #COMMONQUESTION
	- The emission of photoelectrons is instantaneous if the frequency is above the frequency
	- Increasing the intensity has no effect on energy, as intensity just means the amount of photons per second, but they don't have enough energy to cause emission
- **Work function** $\phi$ (eV or J) -> The minimum energy needed to remove a single electron from the surface of a particular metal

### Explained (step-by-step)
- Photons of light (often UV) are incident on a metal (often zinc)
- These photons are absorbed in individual electrons in the metal surface
- It is a one to one interaction, one photon causes the emission of one photoelectron
- The electrons need to have absorbed enough energy to overcome the *work function* of the metal
- The frequency of the incident light must be greater than the threshold frequency
- The emission of photoelectrons is instantaneous
- State all and explain (explain the symbols) for Einstein's Photoelectric Equation $hf = \phi + KE_{max}$
- Intensity only effects the number of photoelectrons emitted, not their energy

## Einstein's Photoelectric Effect Equation
- $hf = \phi + KE_{max}$
	- If the photon has more energy than is needed the remaining energy is transferred into the kinetic energy of the photoelectron
	- Energy of photon = minimum energy required to release electron + maximum kinetic enery of photoelectron
	- The kinetic energy given to a photoelectron is a maximum as some surface electrons might be closer to the positive metal ions than others so might need more energy to be released (remember work function is the minimum energy needed)

### Graphs
- $KE_{max} = hf - \phi$
	- $y = mx + c$
	- A graph of $KE_{max}$ plotted against $f$
	- Graphs could also be given as $V$ (p.d.) vs $f$
	- Therefore the gradient is always $h$, Planck's constant
	- Therefore the y-intercept is $-\phi$, the negative work function

### Stopping Potential
- $eV = KE_{max}$
	- $\therefore eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
