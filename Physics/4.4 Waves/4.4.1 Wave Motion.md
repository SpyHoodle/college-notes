## Wave Properties (GCSE)
- **Wavelength (λ)** -> Minimum distance between two phase points ($\text{m}$)
- **Amplitude** -> Maximum displacement from the equilibrium position ($\text{m}$)
- **Frequency (f)** -> Amount of wavelengths passing a point in a unit of time ($\text{Hz}$)
- **Wave speed (v)** -> Distance travelled in a unit of time ($\text{m s}^{-1})$

## Wave Properties (A-Level)
- **Period of oscillation (T)** -> Time taken for one oscillation ($\text{s}$)
- **Displacement (s)** -> Distance from the equilibrium position in a particular direction (vector) ($\text{m}$)
- **Phase difference (Φ)** -> Difference between the displacements of particles along a wave
	- **In phase** -> Points with the same displacement
	- **Anti-phase** -> Points with opposite displacements
	- $\phi = \frac{x}{\lambda} \cdot 360\degree$

## Radians
- **1 radian** -> is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc of length equal to the radius
	- $45\degree = \frac{\pi}{4}$
