## Wave Properties (GCSE)
- **Wavelength (λ)** -> Minimum distance between two phase points ($\text{m}$)
- **Amplitude** -> Maximum displacement from the equilibrium position ($\text{m}$)
- **Frequency (f)** -> Amount of wavelengths passing a point in a unit of time ($\text{Hz}$)
- **Wave speed (v)** -> Distance travelled in a unit of time ($\text{m s}^{-1})$

## Wave Properties (A-Level)
- **Period of oscillation (T)** -> Time taken for one oscillation ($\text{s}$)
- **Displacement (s)** -> Distance from the equilibrium position in a particular direction (vector) ($\text{m}$)
- **Phase difference (Φ)** -> Difference between the displacements of particles along a wave
	- **In phase** -> Points with the same displacement ($0\degree$)
	- **Anti-phase** -> Points with opposite displacements ($180\degree$)
	- $\phi = \frac{x}{\lambda} \cdot 360\degree$

## Radians
- **1 radian** -> is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc of length equal to the radius
	- $45\degree = \frac{\pi}{4}$

## Refraction
- **Refraction** -> The change in direction of a wave as it changes speed when it passes from one medium to another
	- There will always be some partial reflection
	- If it slows down it will refract towards the normal, vice versa
	- Frequency stays the same, but wavelength changes
	- For water waves, if the depth changes then the waves are refracted

## Reflection
- **Reflection** -> The change in a direction of a wave at a boundary between two different media, so that the wave remains in the original medium
	- Frequency and wavelength stay the same

## Diffraction
- **Diffraction** -> The phenomenon in which waves passing through a gap or around an obstacle spread out
	- ![[2022-09-22-diffraction-at-sea.png]]
	- When the wavelength of a wave is a similar size to the obstacle or gap in a barrier, diffraction occurs

	- If the wavelength does not match the size of the gap, only a small amount of diffraction will occur

## Polarisation
- **Polarised wave** -> A transverse wave that only oscillates in one fixed direction/plane
	- Plane polarised wave = Polarised wave

### Nature of Electromagnetic Waves
- Electromagnetic waves consist of an oscillating electric field coupled with an oscillating magnetic field
	- ![[2022-09-22-electromagnetic-wave-fields.png]]
- Both oscillating fields are at right angles to each other
- The fields are produced by the vibration of electrons

### Light
- Light from the sun or a bulb is unpolarised -> it has vibrations in all planes
- Light from a laser is polarised -> it has vibrations in one direction only

### Polarisation of Waves
- Only transverse waves can be polarised
	- Because their oscillations are at $90\degree$ to the direction of energy transfer
- Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised 
	- Because their oscillations are at $180\degree$ (parallel) to the direction of energy transfer
