# Refractive Index
2022-09-29 | [[11 Waves 1]]

## Refractive Index
- Different media refract light by different amounts
- Refraction is due to the change in speed of the wave as it changes medium
- So we need to compare the relative speeds of light in the materials
- $n = \frac{c}{v}$
	- Where $n$ is the refractive index and $v$ is the speed of the wave in a medium
	- The refractive index of air is 1.00 (3 s.f.)
	- Refractive index cannot be less than 1 as the speed of light is on top

## Snell's Law
- $n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$
	- Where $\theta$ is the angle of incidence
