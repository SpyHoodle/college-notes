# Diffraction and Polarisation

## Diffraction
- **Diffraction** -> The phenomenon in which waves passing through a gap or around an obstacle spread out
	- ![[2022-09-22-diffraction-at-sea.png]]
	- When the wavelength of a wave is a similar size to the obstacle or gap in a barrier, diffraction occurs

	- If the wavelength does not match the size of the gap, only a small amount of diffraction will occur

## Polarisation
- **Polarised wave** -> A transverse wave that only oscillates in one fixed direction/plane
	- Plane polarised wave = Polarised wave

### Nature of Electromagnetic Waves
- Electromagnetic waves consist of an oscillating electric field coupled with an oscillating magnetic field
	- ![[2022-09-22-electromagnetic-wave-fields.png]]
- Both oscillating fields are at right angles to each other
- The fields are produced by the vibration of electrons

### Light
- Light from the sun or a bulb is unpolarised -> it has vibrations in all planes
- Light from a laser is polarised -> it has vibrations in one direction only

### Polarisation of Waves
- Only transverse waves can be polarised
	- Because their oscillations are at $90\degree$ (perpendicular) to the direction of energy transfer
- Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised 
	- Because their oscillations are at $180\degree$ (parallel) to the direction of energy transfer
