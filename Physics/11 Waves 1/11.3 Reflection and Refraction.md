# Reflection and Refraction
2022-09-22 | [[11 Waves 1]]

## Refraction
- **Refraction** -> The change in direction of a wave as it changes speed when it passes from one medium to another
	- There will always be some partial reflection
	- If it slows down it will refract towards the normal, vice versa
	- Frequency stays the same, but wavelength changes
	- For water waves, if the depth changes then the waves are refracted

## Reflection
- **Reflection** -> The change in a direction of a wave at a boundary between two different media, so that the wave remains in the original medium
	- Frequency and wavelength stay the same
