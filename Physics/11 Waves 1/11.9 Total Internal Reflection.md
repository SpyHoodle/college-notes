# Total Internal Reflection
2022-10-05 | [[11 Waves 1]]

- Happens at the boundary between two different materials
- All light is reflected inside the medium, none is refracted out
- Incidence angle has to be greater than the critical angle
- Must be from a high to a low refractive index to slow the wave down
- **Critical Angle** -> The angle at which light refracts along the boundary
	- $n_1 \sin C = 1 \sin 90$
	- $n = \frac{1}{\sin C}$
