# Progressive Waves and Wave Properties
2022-09-21 | [[11 Waves 1]]

## Progressive Waves
- **Progressive Wave** -> an oscillation that travels through matter (or a vacuum)
	- All progressive waves transfer energy from one place to another
	- E.g. P-waves, S-waves, sound, water waves 

### Displacement
- When the wave travels through the medium, the particles move from their original position to a new position
- They exert forces on each other
- A displaced particle experiences a restoring force from its neighbours and is pulled back to it's original position 

## Wave Properties
- **Wavelength (λ)** -> Minimum distance between two phase points ($\text{m}$)
- **Amplitude** -> Maximum displacement from the equilibrium position ($\text{m}$)
- **Frequency (f)** -> Amount of wavelengths passing a point in a unit of time ($\text{Hz}$)
- **Wave speed (v)** -> Distance travelled in a unit of time ($\text{m s}^{-1})$
- **Period of oscillation (T)** -> Time taken for one oscillation ($\text{s}$)
- **Displacement (s)** -> Distance from the equilibrium position in a particular direction (vector) ($\text{m}$)
- **Phase difference (Φ)** -> Difference between the displacements of particles along a wave
	- **In phase** -> Points with the same displacement ($0\degree$)
	- **Anti-phase** -> Points with opposite displacements ($180\degree$)
	- $\phi = \frac{s}{\lambda} \cdot 360\degree$
		- Where $s$ is the distance between two points

## Radians
- **1 radian** -> is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc of length equal to the radius
	- $45\degree = \frac{\pi}{4}$
