- **Intensity** -> The radiant power passing through a surface per unit area
	- $I = \frac{P}{A}$
	- $I = \frac{P}{4 \pi r^2}$
		- This is known as an inverse square relationship -> $I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$
	- If we are told the distance between the core of an object and another, imagine expanding out the spherical object and using that distance as that's radius

## Intensity and Amplitude
- Increase the amplitude -> increases the energy transferred
	- E.g. sound waves get louder
- The particles oscillate further so must move faster -> they have more kinetic energy
- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- Which leads to $\text{intensity} \propto \text{(amplitude)}^2$ #NOTONDATASHEET
