## The Electromagnetic Spectrum
- The electromagnetic spectrum and all the wavelengths in order have to be remembered![[2022-09-26-electromagnetic-wave-spectrum.png]]

### Overlap in Wavelength between Gamma and X-ray
- EM waves are classified by origin not their wavelength
- X-rays are formed by electrons hitting a target, gamma rays come from nuclei of atoms

### Properties
- EM waves can
	- Be refracted
	- Be reflected
	- Be diffracted
	- Be polarised
	- All travel at the speed of light in a vacuum
	- Travel through a vacuum
- As they all travel at $c$, the speed of light, the wave equation can be written as $c = f \lambda$
