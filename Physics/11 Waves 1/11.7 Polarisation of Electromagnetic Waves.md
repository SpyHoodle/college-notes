## Uses of Polarisation
### Polaroid Sunglasses
- When light is reflected from surfaces (e.g. water) it is partially plane polarised
- Polaroid lenses can be used to reduce glade from objects by absorbing the plane polarised light

### Stress Analysis
- When materials are stressed (e.g. parts of the fuselage of an aeroplane) some parts may become more stressed than other parts
- Engineers make models from transparent plastic to analyse the effect of stress on the design
- When the model is viewed through a Polaroid lens the areas which have the largest stress show up where the coloured lines are closest together
