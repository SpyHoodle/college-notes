- To make the program easier to write
- Instead of duplication -> we can use iteration

## Collection
- **Array** -> Collection of variables stored next to each other in memory which
	- share the same name
	- can be accessed with indexing
	- only stores the same type
- **List** -> Arrays that can accept multiple data types for its values which are not stored in the same place in memory
	- Can be expanded by appending values (adding to the end)
