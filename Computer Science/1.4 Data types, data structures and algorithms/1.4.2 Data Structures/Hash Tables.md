- **Hash table** -> known as a dictionary in python
	- Uses an algorithm to determine where to place it into memory
		- Which means that accessing the hash table is fast and efficient
		- However, collisions could happen, so we can make the length of memory bigger and use hashing algorithms to prevent this
