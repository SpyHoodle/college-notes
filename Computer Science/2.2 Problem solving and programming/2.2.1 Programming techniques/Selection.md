# Selection
2022-09-20 Tue

- **Selection** -> A programming construct that allows a program to run sequences of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to `True` or `False`
	- E.g. an if statement in python, rhombus in a flowchart
- **Switch/case statement** -> An alternative method of handling a lot of options
	- Makes the code clearer for another programmer to follow
- **Nested selection** -> Implements branching logic
	- If a condition on the main selection block is `True` then it leads to sub-conditions
