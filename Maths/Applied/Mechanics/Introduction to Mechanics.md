## Mechanics
- Concerns motion, forces, and how the two relate to each other

## Modelling Assumptions
- **Particle** -> Dimensions of object are negligible
	- Mass of object concentrated at single point
	- Ignore rotational forces and air resistance
- **Rough/Smooth surface**
	- Objects in contact with surface does/does not experience friction
- **Smooth/Light pulley** -> No friction
	- Tension is the same in the string either side of the pulley
	- Pulley has no mass
- **In-extensible string** -> String does not stretch under load
	- Acceleration is the same in any connected objects
- **Rod** -> One dimension is negligible, like a pole or beam
	- Mass is concentrated along a line
	- Rigid
- **Peg/Support** -> A support from which a body can be suspended or rested
	- Dimensionless and fixed
	- Can be rough or smooth depending on the question

## Vectors
- $i$ -> Horizontal component
- $j$ -> Vertical component
$$6i - 8j = 
\begin{pmatrix}  
	6\\
	-8
\end{pmatrix}$$
