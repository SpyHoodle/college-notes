# Coding
2022-09-20 | [[2 Data presentation and interpretation]]

- **Coding** -> A method of simplifying and compacting data to make it more efficient and easier to do calculations with
	- When decoding the mean, you completely rearrange the formula
	- When decoding the standard deviation or other measures of spread, you only undo the multiplicative calculations
	- This is because spread is only affected by multiplication when coding the values
		- Moving the values all up by 5 wont affect the spread

$$
\text{Coding: } y = \frac{x - A}{c}
$$
$$
\text{Then: } \bar{x} = A + c\bar{y}
\text{ and } \sigma_x = c\sigma_y
$$
