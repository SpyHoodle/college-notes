## Histograms
- 19-25 -> A boundary of 18.5-25.5
- Area of each rectangle = frequency
- Height of the rectangle = frequency density
- $\text {Frequency density} = \frac{\text {Frequency}}{\text {Class width}}$

## Outliers
- An outlier is usually defined as
	- Being greater than $Q_3 + k \cdot (Q_3 - Q_1)$
	- Being less than $Q_1 - k \cdot (Q_3 - Q_1)$
- Outliers are shown on a box plot as a star, and the max value then becomes the next value below the outlier
