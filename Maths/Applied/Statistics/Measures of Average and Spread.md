# Measures of average and spread
2022-09-15 Thu

**Binomial distribution** -> A case where there are two modes for a set of data

## Standard Deviation
- **Mean** -> Arithmetic average of a set of numbers
	- Mean for a set of numbers:
	  $\bar x = \frac{\Sigma x}{n}$
- **Variance** -> Average of the squared differences from the mean
- **Standard deviation** -> How far away values are from the mean on average
	- Square root of the variance
		- $\text {Variance} = \sigma ^2$
- Standard deviation for a set of numbers:
  $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma (x - \bar x)^2}{n}}$
- However it is much easier to use:
  $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma x^2}{n} - \bar x^2}$

## Frequency Distributions & Grouped Data
- Mean for a frequency distribution:
  $\bar x = \frac{\Sigma fx}{\Sigma f}$
- Standard deviation for a frequency distribution:
  $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma f(x - \bar x)^2}{\Sigma f}}$
- Again it is much easier to use this form:
  $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma fx^2}{\Sigma f} - \bar x^2}$
- For grouped data -> use these equations except use mid-points of the boundaries
