# Sampling

## Definitions
- **Population** -> The whole set of items that are of interest
	- **Sampling frame** -> Population items that are numbered to form a list
		- **Sampling unit** -> Each item in the sampling frame
	- **Sample** -> A subset of the population intended to represent it
	- **Census** -> Data collected from the whole population
- **Random** -> Each member in the population has an equal chance of being chosen

### Census
***Advantages***
- Should give completely accurate result

***Disadvantages***
- Time consuming and expensive
	- Large volume of data to process -> difficult
- Can not be used when testing involves destruction
	- E.g. testing all avocados to see if they are ripe destroys them by opening them

### Sample
***Advantages***
- Quick, easy and cheap
	- Less data to process

***Disadvantages***
- May not be accurate
- May not be large enough to represent small sub-groups

## Types of data
- **Qualitative** (categorical) -> non-numerical e.g. favourite colour
- **Quantitative** -> numerical values
	- **Discrete** -> Can only have a specific set values (cant go in-between values)
		- E.g. rounded age, shoe sizes, rolling a die
	- **Continuous** -> Can take on any value within an interval (usually measured)
		- E.g. exact age, height, temperature

## Types of Sampling
- **Simple Random Sampling** -> Every member of the population has an equal chance of being randomly selected
	- Widely accepted as it minimises bias
	- Impractical to assign numbers to each member with a big population
	- Randomness of selection may not reflect the makeup of the population
- **Systematic Sampling** -> Items are chosen from regular intervals from a list
	- Simple and quick to use
	- Suitable for large populations
	- Could be biased if there was a periodic pattern within the data set
- **Opportunity Sampling** -> Sampling the first set number of participants that are available
	- Easy and cheap to do
	- Sample is not chosen at random and could be biased
		- May not be representative of the whole population
- **Stratified Sampling** -> Population is divided into distinct subgroups based on personal qualities and then random sample them to create a proportional sample of the population
	- The equation for calculating a category size is:
	  $\text {Size of category in sample} = \frac{\text {size of category in population}}{\text {total size of population}}\cdot \text {total sample size}$
	- Sample should be representative of the whole population
	- Can be time consuming and expensive to plan as care must be taken
	- Some subgroups are not easily defined as some are
- **Quota Sampling** -> Population is divided into distinct subgroups based on personal qualities and then opportunity sampled to meet quotas to created a proportional sample of the population
	- Easy and cheap to do
	- Reflects proportions of some characteristic of the population
	- Sample is not chosen at random and could be biased
		- E.g. researcher could be tempted to only ask those who look helpful
