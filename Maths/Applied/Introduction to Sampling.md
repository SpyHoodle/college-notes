# Introduction to Sampling
Friday 2022-09-09 | [[Maths]]

## Definitions
- **Population** -> The whole set of items that are of interest
	- **Sample** -> A subset of the population intended to represent it
	- **Census** -> Data collected from the whole population

### Census
***Advantages***
- Should give completely accurate result

***Disadvantages***
- Time consuming and expensive
	- Large volume of data to process -> difficult
- Can not be used when testing involves destruction
	- E.g. testing all avocados to see if they are ripe destroys them by opening them

### Sample
***Advantages***
- Quick, easy and cheap
	- Less data to process

***Disadvantages***
- May not be accurate
- May not be large enough to represent small sub-groups

## Types of data
- **Qualitative** (categorical) -> non-numerical e.g. favourite colour
- **Quantitative** -> numerical values
	- **Discrete** -> Can only have a specific set values (cant go in-between values)
		- E.g. rounded age, shoe sizes, rolling a die
	- **Continuous** -> Can take on any value within an interval (usually measured)
		- E.g. exact age, height, temperature
